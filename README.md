# COVID Check-In

## Purpose

**COVID Check-In**'s idea is an easy way to exchange contact data with places (e.g. restaurant) in the current pandemic. The main identification of this app is that user interaction is very minimal and user data is not stored on any server but on local devices at the visited place. When a user accepts the whole data transfer process is performed automatically.
